<h1> Introduction to myself</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Akash Chandra and I work as a web developer. I am a software engineer who loves to create websites as well as apps for people.<br />
 I think that people should look at the bigger picture when they are building something. I love to work in groups where everyone <br />
can voice their opinions and ideas. In the end, I love to work towards one goal where in the end we all can contribute towards making a good website.<br /> 
In my free time, you can see me listening to songs and binge-watching series when I am not working with my clients. </p>
